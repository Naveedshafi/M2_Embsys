# Project : Door Alarm To Ensure Security

# Introduction: This microcontroller-controlled door alarm uses an ultrasonic sensor that can be placed near the door to determine whether or not someone is there. The buzzer starts buzzing whenever someone enters the range of the ultrasonic sensor. The detecting range of the sensor can be modified depending on the door. This is also capable of acting as a motion detector.

# Components
	* Arduino Mega :Arduino can be used to develop stand-alone interactive objects or can be connected to software on your computer 
  * Ultrasonic sensor : Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 is utilized here to recognize the presence of any person at the door. The sensor module involves an ultrasonic transmitter,           receiver as well as a control circuit.It includes two circular eyes out of which one is utilized to transmit the ultrasonic wave and the other to receive it.
  * Buzzer : Alerts when someone is near the ultrasonic sensor
  * power supply : External source of power supply is required of the components like ardiuno, microcontroller,buzzer,ultrasonic sensor.

 ## High Level Requirements
 
 To detect the presence of anyone standing within the range on sensor
 To turn on the alarm when the distance between the ultrasonic sensor and the person is very less.

 ## Low Level Requirements
 
 Interface HC-SR04( Ultrasonic Sensor) with Atemega8.
 Interface Buzzer with Atmega8.
 To give an alert after the task is completed.


# SWOT
## Strengths:
Easy to understand and use.
Range for the ultra sonic sensors can be adjusted according to user.
Can be used in dark environment.
Least affected by dust, dirt and moisture environment.
## Weakness:
Sensing accuracy affected by changes in temperature of 5-10 degrees or more.
Objects covered in a very soft fabric absorb more sound waves making it hard for the sensor to see the target.
## Opportunities:
Can be used by every household to ensure security.
Can also be installed for lockers.
## Threats:
Other Sensors with greater efficiency can replace this.
Many other similar application are available.
